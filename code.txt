Peak/off peak hours table:
between 00 hours to 06 hours: off-peak hours
between 06 hours to 22 hours: peak hours
between 22 hours to 00 hours: off-peak hours

Make switch active (allowing battery to be recharged):
When SOC level is below 95% and when off-peak hours are in effect
OR
When DoD SOC level of battery type selected has been reached regardless of whether off-peak or peak hours are in effect.

Make switch inactive:
When DoC SOC level of battery type selected has been reached
